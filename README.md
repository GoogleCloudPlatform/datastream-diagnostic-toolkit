# Datastream Diag Collect v2208 (2022-08-22) by Shane Borden (datastream-diagnostic-toolkit)
Scripts used to collect diagnostic information for the Google Datastream product

Datastream Diag Collect is a "free to use" script that collects Diagnostic Information
from an Oracle Database used by the Datastream product. Since most of the metadata collected
comes from DBA_HIST and ASH Views, the system where it runs must have a valid Oracle Diagnostics Pack License.

## Steps

1. Connect to a Host as oracle
2. Transfer and Unzip datastreamOraDiag.zip and navigate to datastreamOraDiag directory
3. Source in the appropriate database
4. Connect into SQL*Plus as SYS or user with query access to the data dictionary (i.e. DBA),
   then execute @sql/datastreamOraDiagCollect.sql
5. Script will prompt for a timeframe.  Please enter a time 15 minutes before the issue occurred
   until 15 minutes after in the following format:  YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI
6. Provide to requestor all files generated by this script on current directory
   (i.e. datastream_diag_output_hostname_database_yyyymmdd_hh24mi.zip)
7.  Return the zipfile to support

## Troubleshooting Notes

1. Ignore possible errors like:

   "SP2-0310: unable to open file "--sql/..."
   "ORA-01219: database not open:..."
   "ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL..."
   "SP2-0546: User requested Interrupt or EOF detected."
